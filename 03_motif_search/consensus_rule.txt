#50/75 sequence consensus rule (DNA)

how it works:
- capital letter if the relative frequency of a single nucleotide is > 0.5 
  and greater than twice the relative frequency of the second most frequent nucleotide. 
- when no single base satisfies these criteria, 
  a pair of bases are assigned co-consensus status if the sum of the relative frequencies of the two is > 0.75. 
- if neither of these two criteria is fulfilled at a position, 
- if two bases have the same higher frequency, they are reported as co-dominant.
