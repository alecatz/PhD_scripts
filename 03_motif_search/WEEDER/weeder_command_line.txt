weederlauncher.out filename organism analysis <additional parameters>
	organism = AT (for A.thaliana)
	analysis = small|medium|large|extra (6-8|6-10|6-12|6-12, approximated 8 and 10)
	
	S = search both strands
	A = try to find motif in all sequences (default some)
	M = motif expected to appear more than once per sequence (changes statistical evaluation)
	T<n> = n of motifs to report (in any case, only significant ones are shown)

NOTE: OUTPUT folder is the same as INPUT folder! output files named after input files, with different suffix

ex. of job:
./weederlauncher.out /home/alessia/MOTIFS_weeder_results/1000up_FC2x/DElist_bZIP11e63_up1000.txt AT medium S T20 

the launcher command is translated in the following inependent jobs:
./weederTFBS.out -f /home/alessia/MOTIFS_weeder_results/1000up_FC2x/DElist_bZIP11e63_up1000.txt -R 50 -O AT -W 6 -e 1 -N -S -T 20
./weederTFBS.out -f /home/alessia/MOTIFS_weeder_results/1000up_FC2x/DElist_bZIP11e63_up1000.txt -R 50 -O AT -W 8 -e 2 -N -S -T 20 
./weederTFBS.out -f /home/alessia/MOTIFS_weeder_results/1000up_FC2x/DElist_bZIP11e63_up1000.txt -R 50 -O AT -W 10 -e 3 -N -S -T 20 

	R = motif should appear in at least 50% of the sequences (default)
	e = allowed changes from motif consensus
